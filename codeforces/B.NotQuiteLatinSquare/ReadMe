the trick in the code :
auto it = find(vec.begin(), vec.end(), arr[i]);
if (it != vec.end()) {
    vec.erase(it);
}

auto it = find(vec.begin(), vec.end(), arr[i]);:

find is an algorithm provided by the C++ Standard Library that searches for a value in a range defined by iterators.
vec.begin() returns an iterator pointing to the beginning of the vector vec.
vec.end() returns an iterator pointing to the end of the vector vec.
arr[i] is the value that we are searching for in the range.
The find function searches for the value arr[i] in the range [vec.begin(), vec.end()) and returns an iterator pointing to the first occurrence of the value if found, or vec.end() if the value is not found.
The auto keyword is used to automatically deduce the type of the iterator returned by find.
if (it != vec.end()) {:

This condition checks if the iterator it is not equal to vec.end(). If the value arr[i] was found in the vector vec, it will point to the position where the value was found.
vec.erase(it);:

If the value arr[i] was found in the vector vec, this line erases the element at the position pointed to by the iterator it.
This effectively removes the element from the vector.
Example: Suppose we have a vector vec containing elements 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', and 'E'. We want to remove the element 'C' from the vector using the provided code snippet.
